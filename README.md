files to automate the setup of my home lab

I'm setting up a RH gluster storage -cluster and a Red Hat Virtualization  cluster on top of that and a Red Hat Satellite server to start with and to manage all that. 

Trying to obsolete backups, by automating the setup of the whole datacenter.

I try not to rely on additional deployment infrastructure except of the satellite - as this would need to be set up somehow as well.

This repository may be freely used but i do not focus on a general prupose usage.
