== Summary

This document aims to give some basic troubleshooting tips and recommendations for help diagnose issues with the RHEV environment

=== Raise A Ticket

If you arent able to quickly resolve this issue yourself, you should get a ticket raised with Red Hat as soon as possible. The sooner you engage them, the sooner they will be able to assist. Ideally the ticket would be raised by an approved TAM contact, ensuring the TAM is made aware as soon as possible.

=== Killing a VM in an Unknown State

the following process should be followed in order to resolve a VM that is in an unknown state.

* Identify which HV the VM is/was running on, from the Web UI
* Connect via SSH to the HV (identified above)
* Use virsh to list the state of the VM
+
 virsh -r list

* Attempt to use vdsClient to cleanly kill the VM
+
 vsdClient localhost shutdown <vm> 0 none force=1
 vsdClient localhost destroy <vm> #Note - destroy does NOT remove the VM, just terminates it

* If the above steps fail to kill the VM, identify the pid of the qemu-kvm task for the particular machine
+
 ps aux | grep qemu-kvm

* If you have time, it may be useful to get a dump of the current VM for later analysis by Red Hat, if required
+
 gcore -o <location with enough disk space> <PID identified above>

+
This file would compress very well, so you should gzip it to save space. Items of up to 1G can be added to cases directly via the web. (A recent 13G core file compressed to about 433M)

* user the kill command to kill the VM
+
 kill <PID identified above>
 or
 kill -9 <PID identified above>

=== Failure to migrate VMs to/from a HV

If you are unable to migrate a VM to/from a particular Hypervisor, it may be related to a misconfiguration of the move network

Check that

* the move IP address is pingable from other HVs
* the correct bonding is set (mode 4 LACP usually)
