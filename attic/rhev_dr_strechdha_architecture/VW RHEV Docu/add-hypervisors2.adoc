== Introduction

One of the requirements that Volkswagen tasked Red Hat to provide was a simple and repeatable way to add or re-add hypervisors into RHEV-M. As RHEV provides a rich API, this was certainly possible and a python script was developed to do the majority of the work. _The full script can be found in the Appendix_

The process of adding a new hypervisor consists of three phases

. Pre-requisites
. Running the add script
. Post script tasks

=== Pre-requisites

=== Adjustments of basic files before setting the hypervisor up

There are a couple of files that need to be changed before we start, one will facilitate better performance for the VMs under heavy load (mon.conf) and one will exclude the local disks from multipath.

__The first one (mom.conf) will be not need to be changed in future versions of RHEV as it will be the default__

./etc/vdsm/mom.conf

# ### DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENT -- MOM Configuration for VDSM ###

# sets up monitoring and control for newly-created guests and cleans up after
# deleted guests.

# The interface MOM using to discover active guests and collect guest memory
# statistics. There're two choices for it: libvirt or vdsm.

# to each enabled controller plugin.

# Set this to an existing, writable directory to enable plotting.  For each
# invocation of the program a subdirectory momplot-NNN will be created where NNN
# is a sequence number.  Within that directory, tab-delimited data files will be
# created and updated with all data generated by the configured Collectors.

# Activate the RPC server on the designated port (-1 to disable).  RPC is
# disabled by default until authentication is added to the protocol.

# At startup, load a policy from the given directory.  If empty, no policy is loaded
policy-dir: /etc/vdsm/mom.d

[logging]
# Set the destination for program log messages.  This can be either 'stdio' or
# a filename.  When the log goes to a file, log rotation will be done
# automatically.
log: /var/log/vdsm/mom.log

# Set the logging verbosity level.  The following levels are supported:
# 5 or debug:   Debugging messages
# 4 or info:    Detailed messages concerning normal program operation
# 3 or warn:    Warning messages (program operation may be impacted)
# 2 or error:   Errors that severely impact program operation
# 1 or critical:  Emergency conditions
# This option can be specified by number or name.
verbosity: info

## The following two variables are used only when logging is directed to a file.
# Set the maximum size of a log file (in bytes) before it is rotated.

Additionally in the B2X zone the /etc/hosts has to be extended so it contains every host in the cluster. In B2X this is necessary due to the lack of DNS. If one host can not resolve the other hosts by name, migration will not work.


=== Running the add script

The script is designed to run in three modes

1. Interactive Mode - In this mode, triggered by running the script with no parameters, you will be prompted to enter all the details required
2. DNS Mode - In this mode, trggered by providing just one parameter (the FQDN of the VM) you will still be prompted for each piece of information, but DNS lookups will be used to attempt to provide sensible defaults that can be accepted by simply hittin enter. The script is also Zone aware, again based on the hostname, it will determin if the VM is destined for the **B2X** Zone or the **Intranet** Zone. Subnet masks and gateways will be determined based on this information and provided as defaults, which can be overriden
3. Script mode - This mode in non-interactive, and so all the information must be provided by providing three parameters at run time - **This has not been coded yet**

==== Interactive Mode
In interactive mode, entered by providing zero parameters, you will be required to interactively provide all the information to the script. Some limited error checking, such as checking the format of an IP adddress, is provided but please take care when entering information to the script. You will be given the chance to verify the details before proceeding

==== DNS Mode
Below is an example of the script being run in **DNS Mode**. One parameter was passed (lxf102s001.wob.sec.vwg.vw) and then the user was prompted for each piece of information with sensible defaults shown inside square brackets
As mentioned above, the script will determine which zone the VM should be in, and contact the correct RHEV-M instance. If the required certificate is not present, it will be downloaded.

=== Post script tasks

==== Migration Bandwidth

The defailt setting for migration bandwidth is 32 MiB/s bandwidth which is equal to 256 Mb/s. For most workloads this is perfectly fine. However, in the VW setup we have some **large** VMs (VMs with 1TB of RAM). VMs of this size will necessitate additional configuration. As the migration network is on bond2, which has 10Gbps bonded interfaces, we should increase the migration bandwidth to facilitate the migration of this VM. We should change this to 120 MiB/s.

. Temporarily disable the power management of the hosts.

. Add the below parameter in the [vars] section of /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf

 [vars]
 ...
 migration_max_bandwidth = 120


. Restart the vdsmd service

    /etc/init.d/vdsmd restart

. Re-enable power management for the hosts
