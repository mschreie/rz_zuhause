Load Balancing:

Replication:
http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.1:_Understanding_Replication
-> automatic failover when using the Gluster native client

http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.1:_Understanding_Virtual_Machine_Image_Storage
-> offering automatic failover (when using the Gluster native client) 
-> and always-on performance even during a self-heal process.

2-way replication described here:

Managing Split Brain:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/3.1/html-single/Administration_Guide/index.html#sect-Managing_Split-brain

Server-Side Quorum:
2 nodes -> HA ineffective
  -> healing: 4 nodes 
  - >dummy node with no bricks

Client Site Quorum:
cluster.quorum-type = auto
takes "first brick" into account. are exactly 50% online, then the FIRST brick needs to be online to allow writing still.

inconsistent:
throughout the document old versions are stated
e.g 
Page 5: Gluster v. 3.0 x86_64
Page 6: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 hypervisors
Page 8: You can use the following hypervisors as hosts:
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 3.4
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5

Chapter 5: . Recommended Best Practices and Troubleshooting
* Enable the server side quorum at all times for the Red Hat Gluster Storage volumes hosting virtual
machine images. For more information, see section, Configuring Server-Side Quorum in the Red Hat
Gluster Storage Administration Guide
* Red Hat Gluster Storage Volumes that serve as Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Master Storage
Domain contain SANLocks and have the Red Hat Gluster Storage volume profile set to virt. This
enables the Client Side Quorum for 2-way Automatic File Replication and avoids the
inconsistency problems for Multiple Writer situations. For more information see section, Configuring
Client-Side Quorum in the Red Hat Gluster Storage Administration Guide
* Disable the client side quorum for Red Hat Gluster Storage volumes that host Virtual Machines
images for high-availability with 2-way replication.

=> 1, 3 state no client-side quorum only server-side quorum
=> 2 states client side quorum enabled automaticaly
makes no sence to me.



Why GlusterFS:
Gluster Storage Platform and Gluster Filesystem offer the most reliable and simple open source clustered file system running on commodity hardware.

The solution features the following specific advantages:

No metadata server—Gluster Filesystem uses a fully distributed architecture (together with the Gluster Elastic Hash) removing the need for a metadata server and consequently, a potential bottleneck.
High performance global namespace—Gluster Filesystem offer scale out to hundreds of petabytes with linear performance using 10GigE and InfiniBand (native RDMA).
High availability—Gluster Filesystem uses replication to survive hardware failures, and automatically performs self-healing to restore performance. Data is stored using an NFS-like native format.
Stackable userspace design—Simple to install and portable, Gluster Filesystem has no kernel dependencies. The stackable design also enables you to configure specific workload profiles, as required.

====================
reaction in split brain scenario
  - no disruption on storage systems as "client side quorum" takes "primary brick" into account
  - RHEV-M tries to fence the Hosts on the other site - but does not succeed
  - orphaned Hypervisor contiues to run with all VMs
  - SPM is only active on one site but is not needed for running instances
  - no growing of disks possible so thin provisioning is no good option 
  - if split brain disappears the fence-request finds its way, making the cluster missbehave. - Need to find a way out of this.
