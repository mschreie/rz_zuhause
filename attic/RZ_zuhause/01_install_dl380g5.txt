I've downloaded a win64 version of ILO firmware from: 
http://h20564.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/swd/public/readIndex?sp4ts.oid=5294357&swLangOid=8&swEnvOid=4024

unpacked the exe-file by running it and choosing "extract"

Then i used the Web-GUI to upload the version into ILO.

Having installed the following lisence:
ILO 60-Tage lisence:
34T6L-4C9PX-X8D9C-GYD26-8SQWM

I could use the ILO->Remote Console -> Remote Console 
"Access the system KVM from a Java applet-based console requiring the availability of a JVM."
..... which is quite cool.
